# Assignment:
Create a [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) application that calls the [Star Wars API](https://swapi.co/) and both stores and displays the response objects in a `template`, (_without manually resorting the initial data/API response_).

The `template` should be shown in a list format. How you decided to design the layout is up to you. 
_e.g. div, u/ol, flex, grid, floats etcâ€¦_

The application __will__ be checked across browsers for compatibility, including but not limited to the latest: [IE](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/internet-explorer.aspx), [Safari](https://support.apple.com/downloads/safari), [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) & [FireFox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/).

## Submission:
Please provide us with your [GitHub](https://www.github.com) url to the completed assignment.

* Deploy and host the application on a server.
  * _e.g. [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/), [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/)_
